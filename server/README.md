Your backend should now be running on `http://localhost:4001` ðŸš€

In order to test the end-point using swagger or postman, use the following end-points

- `GET http://localhost:4001/positions`: Get all positions
- `GET http://localhost:4001/positions/{id}`: Get a position by id
- `POST http://localhost:4001/positions`: Create a new position
- `PUT http://localhost:4001/positions/{id}`: Update a position by id
- `DELETE http://localhost:4001/positions/{id}`: Delete a position by id
